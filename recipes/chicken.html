   <h2>grilled chicken with veggies</h2>

   <h3>ingredients</h3>

   <ul>
       <li>350 gm chicken</li>
       <li>1/2 cup hung curd</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon powdered black pepper</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>steps</h3>

     <h4>step 1 wash the chicken pieces</h4>
     <p>To prepare this easy chicken recipe, wash the chicken pieces and prick them with a fork.<br>
        Now, in a large bowl, combine hung curd, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chilli powder,<br>
        coriander powder, cumin powder, black pepper, salt and garam masala.<br>
        Stir all the ingredients together until well blended.</p>

     <h4>step 2 Grill it to perfection and serve hot</h4>
     <p>Now add the chicken pieces and apply the masala mixture all over them.<br>
        Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Once done,<br>
        preheat the oven at 190 degree Celsius. Remove the chicken pieces from the <br>
        marinade and place them on a grilling tray. Grill them for 1 hour, flipping <br>
        them after 30 minutes so that both sides can cook evenly. Check if the chicken <br>
        has fully cooked by taking one piece out and cutting it with a knife. Serve hot with salad or a dip.</p>
